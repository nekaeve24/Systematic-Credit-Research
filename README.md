# Systematic-Credit-Research

Quantitative framework for modeling credit risk, factor research, and alpha generation in fixed-income markets.

## Research Pillars
* **Structural Default Modeling**: Implementing Merton-based models to assess corporate probability of default (PD) using equity volatility and leverage ratios.
* **Factor Discovery**: Researching systematic credit factors (Carry, Value, Momentum) across multi-million dollar portfolios.
* **Stochastic Modeling**: Utilizing Jump-Diffusion processes to model credit spread dynamics and "tail-risk" events.
* **Neural Forensics in Finance**: Applying mechanistic interpretability techniques to audit the logic origins of deep learning models used in credit spread prediction.
